# SimpleVideoPlayer
A HTML5 video player that includes useful controls for playing back local content.
To use, pull down the repo and put whatever video you want to watch in the localVideos folder. If you don't want to change any of the html than you also need to rename your video to "video.mp4". If you don't want to rename your video file, you can also just update index.html and change the src attribute of the video source.
Once you have everything setup, you should just be able to open index.html in your favorite browser and the video will play. There are playback rate controls below the video for faster video watching.
