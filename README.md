# SimpleVideoPlayer
A HTML5 video player that includes useful controls for playing back local content.

To use:
- Pull down the repo 
- Put whatever video you want to watch in the localVideos directory. 
  - If you don't want to change any of the html than you name your video  "video.mp4". 
  - If you don't want to rename your video file, you can also just update index.html and change the src attribute of the video source.
- Open index.html in your favorite browser and the video will play. There are playback rate controls below the video for faster video watching.
